  Bluetooth is required to connect your heart rate monitoring device, such as a Bluetooth-enabled heart rate belt, a sports bracelet or sports watch with Bluetooth broadcast and heart rate monitoring. For example, the Apple Watch does not support Bluetooth broadcast and cannot be used.
  Safari(also iOS other browsers) and Firefox does not support <a href="https://caniuse.com/web-bluetooth">Bluetooth API</a>, please use Chrome on your computer or mobile phone.
